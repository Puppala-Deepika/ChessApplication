The left sidebar displays all your online friends. If you click on any of them, then a game request will be sent to your friend. If he/she accepts the game request then you can play the game, else a notification will appear.

If he/she is not your friend, you can make him/her as your fiend as follows:
  Search for your friend using username, and click on the name, then a friend request will be sent. If the other user accepts, then he/she will be added as your friend and you will be notified.

3.Once you start the game, donot refresh the page. Refreshing the page will cancel your game.

Techincal Aspects :-

We need to use real time database for this app . Because while playing the game , the state will be constantly changing and it should be proccessed in real time.

Technologies :-

FireBase ---- Real time database used.

JavaScript ---- For checking validations of chess moves JavaScript is used.

Angular Js ---- Backend i.e entire database part and requests to database etc is written using Angular Js.
